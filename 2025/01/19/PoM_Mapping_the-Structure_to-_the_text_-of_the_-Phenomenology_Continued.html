    <p>The phenomenology of the object on page 168-169 of the Harper Torchbook edition.</p>

<h4 id="perception">Perception:</h4>

<p><strong><em>Consciousness, then, has to go over this cycle again, but not in the same way as on the first occasion.</em></strong></p>

<p>Let’s revisit the repeating circuit of perception:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The object presents itself as a “one”.  I don’t see a “one” but it presents itself as a “one”.</li>
  <li>I see the property in it.  A property is the way we apprehend the object.</li>
  <li>I’m aware that I’m not seeing the object as I first thought, as a “one”, and the untruth belongs to me because the object is the essential fact.</li>
  <li>The “one” is now an extension of its properties, on account of the universality of properties themselves. 
But the continuity is actually a community of opposing and excluding properties.
It’s not the case that the salt is “white” and “tart” and “cubical”.  The object is “salt”.</li>
  <li>The “one” is only what I “mean”.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>For it has found out, regarding perception, that the truth and outcome of perception is its dissolution, is reflection out of and away from the truth into itself.
In this way consciousness becomes definitely aware of how its perceptual process is essentially constituted, viz. that this is not a simple bare apprehension, but in its apprehension is at the same time reflected out of the true content and back into itself.</em></strong></p>

<p>Consciousness is aware that it is consciousness of consciousness of something, a Self.</p>

<p><strong><em>This return of consciousness into itself, which is immediately involved and implicated in that pure apprehension–for this return to self has proved to be essential to perception–alters the true content.</em></strong></p>

<p>We know how it alters the object, by its “sense existence”.</p>

<p><strong><em>Consciousness is aware that this aspect is at the same time its own, and takes it upon itself; and by so doing consciousness will thus get the true object bare and naked.</em></strong></p>

<p>Consciousness is both this aspect and aware of this aspect and if it takes ownership of it and removes it, it can get to the “bare and naked” object.</p>

<p><strong><em>In this way we have, now, in the case of perception, as happened in the case of sensuous certainty, the aspect of consciousness being forced back upon itself; but, in the first instance, not in the sense in which this took place in the former case–i.e not as if the truth of perception fell within it.  Rather consciousness is aware that the untruth, that comes out there, is within it.  By knowing this, however, consciousness is able to cancel and supersede this untruth.</em></strong></p>

<p>Sense-Certainty:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“This”.</li>
  <li>Not “This”.  The universal “This”.</li>
  <li>This “I”.</li>
  <li>Not this “I”, The universal “I”.</li>
  <li>Grasping, not pointing.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Sense-Certainty, ‘This “I”’ was the truth of the object but for the Self of Perception, it is the untruth of the object.</p>

<p><strong><em>It distinguishes its apprehension of the truth from the untruth of its perception, corrects this untruth, and, so far as itself takes in hand to make this correction, the truth, qua truth of perception, certainly falls within its own consciousness.  The procedure of consciousness, which we have now to consider, is thus so constituted that it no longer merely perceives, but is also conscious of its reflection into self, and keeps this apart from simple apprehension proper.</em></strong></p>

<p>Consciousness can grasp the truth of the object if it corrects its own untruth.</p>
